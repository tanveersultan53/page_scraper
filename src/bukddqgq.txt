I'm working in Python and using Flask. When I run my main Python file on my computer, it works perfectly, but when I activate venv and run the Flask Python file in the terminal, it says that my main Python file has "No Module Named bs4." Any comments or advice is greatly appreciated.

Lol, my problem was pipenv installing bs4 with ipython as dev packages and then later reinstalling without including dev. Moving it to prod packages worked.

            Sorted by:
            Reset to default
                    Trending sort available 
Trending sort
Trending sort is based off of the default sorting method — by highest score — but it boosts votes that have happened recently, helping to surface more up-to-date answers.
It falls back to sorting by highest score if no posts are trending.
Switch to Trending sort
                        Highest score (default)
                        Trending (recent votes count more)
                        Date modified (newest first)
                        Date created (oldest first)
            273
Activate the virtualenv, and then install BeautifulSoup4:
$ pip install BeautifulSoup4
When you installed bs4 with easy_install, you installed it system-wide. So your system python can import it, but not your virtualenv python.
If you do not need bs4 to be installed in your system python path, uninstall it and keep it in your virtualenv.
For more information about virtualenvs, read this

Imagine (for the example sake) that you're working on a project that requires a specific version of a module. You might also be working on a different project, requiring a different version of this module.  If each project is located in virtualenvs, you will have two absolutely independent python environments, instead of having a system python environment with two versions of the same module.  Keep your system env clean. Work in virtualenvs.

Also remember that if you're using a venv, you have to use the python binary from that venv. /usr/bin/python (on a Mac OS) is wrong; it should be <your path to your venv>/bin/python

I have been searching far and wide in the internet.
I'm using Python 3.6 and MacOS. I have uninstalled and installed with pip3 install bs4 but that didn't work. It seems like python is not able to detect or search the bs4 module.
This is what worked:
python3 -m pip install bs4
The -m option allows you to add a module name.

If you are using Anaconda for package management, following should do:
conda install -c anaconda beautifulsoup4

The option "-c anaconda" is the default, so "conda install beautifulsoup4" does the same and is easier to memorize :-)

I will advise you to uninstall the bs4 library by using this command:
pip uninstall bs4
and then install it using this command:
sudo apt-get install python3-bs4
I was facing the same problem in my Linux Ubuntu when I used the following command for installing bs4 library:
pip install bs4

If you use Pycharm, go to preferences - project interpreter - install bs4.
If you try to install BeautifulSoup, it will still show that no module named bs4.

It is so annoying to find the answer has nothing to do with BeautifulSoup. To the linux users, be vary of running the command 'python', version 2 exits and you may have forgotten to change the bash file alias of python. And so you might have created the virtual environment using 3 with
python3 -m venv .venv
So, to install things, go with
python3 -m pip install beautifulsoup4
not
pip install beautifulsoup4
Things get installed in different versions and you scratch your head as to what is going on.

I did what @rayid-ali said, except I'm on a Windows 10 machine so I left out the sudo. That is, I did the following:
python3 -m pip install bs4
and it worked like a pycharm. Worked like a charm anyway.

A lot of tutorials/references were written for Python 2 and tell you to use pip install somename. If you're using Python 3 you want to change that to pip3 install somename.

The easiest is using easy_install.
easy_install bs4 
It will work if pip fails.

You might want to try install bs4 with 
pip install --ignore-installed BeautifulSoup4
if the methods above didn't work for you.

Addendum to the original query:
modules.py
help('modules')
$python modules.py
It lists that module bs4 already been installed.
_codecs_kr          blinker             json                six
_codecs_tw          brotli              kaitaistruct        smtpd
_collections        bs4                 keyword             smtplib
_collections_abc    builtins            ldap3               sndhdr
_compat_pickle      bz2                 lib2to3             socket
Proper solution is:
pip install --upgrade bs4
Should solve the problem.
Not only that, it will show same error for other modules as well.
So you got to issue the pip command same way as above for those errored module(s).

The better method is ("-U" : Upgrade all package(s) to the  newest  available  version.) :
$ python3 -m pip install -U pip && python3 -m pip install -U bs4 
or install from apt (Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, etc.) :
$ sudo apt install python3-bs4

One more solution for PyCharm:
Go to File -> Settings -> Python Interpreter, click on plus sign and find beautifulsoup4.
Click install.

You will need to have pip in your PATH environment variable. If you don't have it then use this link: python -m pip install beautifulsoup4
This worked for me. Hopefully, it works for you too.
